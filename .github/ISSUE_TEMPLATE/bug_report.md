## Reproduction
<!-- IF you can reproduce the steps with the expo app at https://expo.io/@jsamr/typeskill, enumerate these steps. The last line after the enumeration is the discussion about what was expected and what happenned instead after last step.

Android Reproduction from the Expo Project:

1. Type "Thansk" ; Android Google Keyboard would suggest "Thanks" instead
2. Press "Thanks" ; "Thanks" should be printed now.
3. Press spacebar

"Thanks" has been overridden with "Thansk" while it shouldn't have. 

OTHERWISE, you must provide a minimal example: https://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve, ideally in the form of a git repository. -->
