## Description

<!-- Describe your issue in detail. It is also very appreciated to add a GIF from the Open Source ScreenCam app on Android, or the embedded screen recorder on iOS. -->


## Reproduction

<!-- Try to reproduce the bug with the debugger: https://github.com/typeskill/debugger. Either use the expo project, or quickly setup your own following the instructions in debugger README. -->

<!-- IF you can reproduce the steps with the debugger, enumerate these steps. For each step, copy and paste the document source with the "copy document source to clipboard" Toolbar button.

The last line after the enumeration is the discussion about what was expected and what happened instead after last step.

Android Reproduction from the Expo Project:

1. Type "Thansk" ; Android Google Keyboard would suggest "Thanks" instead
2. Press "Thanks" ; "Thanks" should be printed now.
3. Press spacebar

"Thanks" has been overridden with "Thansk" while it shouldn't have. 

OTHERWISE, you must provide a minimal example: https://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve in the form of a git repository. -->
