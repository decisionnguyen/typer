## Description

<!-- Describe your issue in detail. It is also very appreciated to add a GIF. -->


## Reproduction

<!-- Try to reproduce the bug with the debugger: https://github.com/typeskill/debugger. Either use the expo project, or quickly setup your own following the instructions in debugger README. -->

<!-- IF you can reproduce the steps with the debugger, enumerate these steps. For each step, copy and paste the document source.

The last line after the enumeration is the discussion about what was expected and what happened instead after last step.

Android Reproduction from the Expo Project:

1. Type "Thansk" ; Android Google Keyboard would suggest "Thanks" instead
2. Press "Thanks" ; "Thanks" should be printed now.
3. Press spacebar

"Thanks" has been overridden with "Thansk" while it shouldn't have. 

OTHERWISE, you should provide a minimal example: https://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve in the form of a git repository. -->
