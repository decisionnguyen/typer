## [0.10.0-alpha.0](https://github.com/typeskill/typeskill/compare/v0.10.0-beta.19...v0.10.0-alpha.0) (2019-10-04)


### âš  BREAKING CHANGES

* removed disableMultipleAttributeEdits Typer prop.
Since this behavior has been proven default on iOS, Typeskill will try
to enforce the same one on Android by default. To make the API more
explicit, it has been found best to rename the prop to narrow the scope
to Android.
